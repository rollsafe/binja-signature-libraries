# Signature libraries for Binary Ninja

This repository will serve as a database of signature libraries for now until a better delivery / update mechanism for signature libraries is implemented. I am also happy to accept any pull requests for community-contributed signature libraries! For more information on how you can install these signature libraries, please check out [this blog post](https://binary.ninja/2020/03/11/signature-libraries.html).
